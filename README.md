# Viz4Climate + Sustainability: IEEE VIS 2024 Workshop on Visualization for Climate Action and Sustainability
Half-day hybrid workshop on October 14th, 2024: Morning
[IEEE Vis 2024 Conference](https://ieeevis.org),
_St. Pete Beach, Fl, USA_

### About
We welcome submissions to the first hybrid online IEEE VIS workshop on visualization for climate action and sustainability. This workshop aims to explore and consolidate the role of data visualization in accelerating action for addressing environmental challenges and climate change. Given the urgency and impact of the environmental crisis, we ask how our skills, research methods, innovations and visualization practice can help by empowering people and organizations. We believe visualization holds an enormous power to aid understanding, decision making, communication, discussion, participation, education, and exploration of complex topics around climate action and sustainability.

This is a hybrid workshop: you can present and attend online or in person provided that you are registered for the VIS2024 conference. Remote attendance has a reduced fee.

### Workshop Goals
- C**ollect research, case studies, examples, and experiences** around working with visualization in the broad area of climate and sustainability. See our submission types below and submit your latest work.
- **Discuss and explore the potential of how visualization knowledge and research** can help address issues around climate change and sustainability by supporting stakeholders in monitoring, decision making, communication, education and advocacy.
- **Understand challenges and opportunities** for visualization research and practice, i.e., which are the problems the field needs to study and explore solutions for; and which are the gains we can drive for our general understanding of visualization from working on climate and sustainability.
- **Build a community** of practitioners and researchers across all fields of visualization and associated areas (e.g. machine learning, climate science, education, advocacy). We particularly encourage (future) collaboration among the attendees.

Besides brief presentations of the accepted submissions, the workshop aims to mostly focus on discussions and planning research through novel collaborations.


### Submissions
The submission portal is now open! Submissions are sent through the VIS 2024 conference system. In order to submit, please do the following:

[Log into PCS](https://new.precisionconference.com). Under submissions:

1. Make a new submission to Society: VGTC
1. Conference/Journal: VIS 2024
1. Track: VIS 2024 Viz4Climate+Sustainability and then click Go.

The workshop solicits three types of submissions:
1. Regular publications (up to 8 pages without references, IEEE VIS paper style) including surveys, case study reports, and original research that advance the field. Authors of accepted submissions will have the opportunity to publish them as part of the IEEE Digital library.
1. Short position statements / semi-public notes (2 - 3 pages without references, IEEE VIS paper style) featuring opinions, experiences, lessons learned, and reflections, which together will contribute diverse viewpoints that enhance collective understanding of, and encourage discussions around the theme of the workshop. Short position statements (.pdf) will be available for download on this website as part of the final program and will not be published in the IEEE Digital Library.
1. Pictorials and interactive demos includes any form of work with a strong focus on visual creation and experience: infographics, posters, interactive demos, VR presentations, data physicalizations, data comics, etc. Submissions should come in the following format:
  - A document (maximum 1,000 words (excluding references)) explaining background, design rationale, and other information deemed important.
  - Supporting material showcasing the work in the form of videos, websites, photos, sketches, etc. Material can be included in the PDF with the writing, be linked from it, or come in extra files.
1. We will publish both the writeup and materials on the conference website.

Submissions are to be formatted in the [regular IEEE VIS double-column paper style](https://ieeevis.org/year/2024/info/call-participation/paper-submission-guidelines).

Anonymity is not mandatory but recommended, following [IEEE VIS's policy](https://ieeevis.org/year/2024/info/call-participation/paper-submission-guidelines#anonymization).

Submissions will be peer-reviewed by the international program committee following [ethics guidelines](https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/conferences/ethics-guidelines/). All submissions will be peer-reviewed and if accepted, could be asked to accommodate minor revisions until the official camera-ready deadline.

### Topics and Questions
The large scope and complex nature of the multi-faceted problem of visualization for climate action and sustainability is best addressed in an half-day dedicated, informal, interactive workshop that brings together diverse contributions, viewpoints, and reflections on the topic, followed by discussions.
The workshop encourages submissions around a broad variety of topics, challenges, and questions including (but not limited to):
- How to balance visual complexity, depth of information, and visual/data literacy?
- How to understand abstract and widely unfamiliar scales of time, space, and numbers?
- How to encode, inform and present efficiently uncertain data? How to deal with heterogeneous data sets (spatial, temporal, relational, multidimensional, 3D, 4D, etc.)?
- How to make model projections more accessible and actionable for a general public?
- How to tailor information and visualization to diverse audiences?
- How to work with policymakers and communities at risk?
- How to create empathy with current and future people and populations?
- How to support carbon accounting and monitoring systems?
- How to track and monitor the circular economy?
- How to support decision making on a personal as well as collaborative level?
- How to foster engagement and participation on a community level?
- How to leverage new and immersive technologies for analysis, communication, and awareness?
- How to train the creators of visualizations?
- How to prevent the misuse of visualization for this topic and provide for critical engagement?
- How to make conferences and our own research practice (e.g., computing power, physical materials, devices, etc.) more sustainable?

For some of these questions, we can start from the techniques and knowledge we have gained about visualization in generalâ€”others might require entirely new ways of thinking across information visualization, scientific visualization, analytics, illustration, information design, human-computer interaction, education, cognition, etc. Addressing these questions can lead to guidelines, collaborative platforms, visualization principles and techniques, toolkits, method- ologies, visualization activities, analysis methods, interactive spaces and experiences, games, and potentially many more.


### Tentative Schedule
- Session 1 (before break; 1hr, 15m) -- Welcome and Scoping (10min), followed by lightning presentations (3m each) of accepted submissions / installations. Questions and answers will follow presentations.
- Session 2 (after break; 1hr, 15m) -- Brief introductions to get in person and remote participants to get acquainted with other attendees. Form discussion groups around topics proposed by the organizers and the audience. Each - - - discussion group is moderated by one of the organizers.
  - How to build immersive spaces and experiences for climate storytelling?
  - How to raise climate education, awareness and change behavior on a personal level?
  - How to support sustainability monitoring, community engagement, and participatory decision making?
